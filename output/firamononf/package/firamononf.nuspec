:   Erik Spiekermann, Ralph du Carrois (Carrois Type Design, Mozilla
    Foundation)

Version

Designed to integrate with the character of the Mozilla FirefoxOS, the
Fira typefaces also aim to cover the legibility needs for a large range
of handsets varying in screen quality and rendering.

Fura Powerline is derived from Fira Sans for Powerline users. The

## Why `Fura` and not `Fira`?

What&#x27;s in a name? The reason for the name change is to comply with the SIL Open Font License (OFL), in partcular the [Reserved Font Name mechanism][SIL-RFN]

Some fonts have parts of their name &quot;reserved&quot; per the [Reserved Font Name mechanism][SIL-RFN]:
&gt; No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
&gt; Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
&gt; Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
&gt; presented to the users.

- The main goals seem to be to: `Avoid collisions`, `Protect authors`, `Minimize support`, and `Encourage derivatives`

See the [Reserved Font Name section][SIL-RFN] for additional information

## Which font?

### TL;DR

* Pick your font family and then select from the `&#x27;complete&#x27;` directory.
  * If you are on Windows pick a font with the `&#x27;Windows Compatible&#x27;` suffix.
    * This includes specific tweaks to ensure the font works on Windows, in particular monospace identification and font name length limitations
  * If you are limited to monospaced fonts (because of your terminal, etc) then pick a font with the `&#x27;Mono&#x27;` suffix.
    * This denotes that the Nerd Font glyphs will be monospaced not necessarily that the entire font will be monospaced

### Ligatures

By the *Nerd Font* policy, the variant with the `&#x27;Mono&#x27;` suffix is not supposed to have any ligatures.
Use the non-*Mono* variants to have ligatures.

### Explanation

Once you narrow down your font choice of family (`Droid Sans`, `Inconsolata`, etc) and style (`bold`, `italic`, etc) you have 2 main choices:

#### `Option 1: Download already patched font`

 * download an already patched font from the `complete` folder
   * This is most likely the one you want. It includes **all** of the glyphs from
