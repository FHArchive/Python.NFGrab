Gohufont TrueType
====================

A font for programming and terminal use.

TrueType automatically traced, with available bitmaps in heights of 11 and 14 pixels.

Copyright 2010 by Hugo Chargois (https://font.gohu.org)

Converted by Guilherme Maeda (github.com/koemaeda)

&lt;b&gt;LICENSE&lt;/b&gt;
This font is released under the terms of the WTFPL (see COPYING-LICENSE).

&lt;b&gt;THANKS AND AKNOWLEDGMENTS&lt;/b&gt;
The Unicode versions of the 11px font are based extensively on the fixed 6x10 font by Markus Kuhn (http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs-fonts.html).
I used the Terminus font in 14 px with great satisfaction for a long time before I decided to make gohufont 14 px, so it surely inspired me and they may share some similarities in appearance. It is not a derivative work though. Thanks to Dimitar Zhekov for his great font.

## Which font?

### TL;DR

* Pick your font family and then select from the `&#x27;complete&#x27;` directory.
  * If you are on Windows pick a font with the `&#x27;Windows Compatible&#x27;` suffix.
    * This includes specific tweaks to ensure the font works on Windows, in particular monospace identification and font name length limitations
  * If you are limited to monospaced fonts (because of your terminal, etc) then pick a font with the `&#x27;Mono&#x27;` suffix.
    * This denotes that the Nerd Font glyphs will be monospaced not necessarily that the entire font will be monospaced

### Ligatures

By the *Nerd Font* policy, the variant with the `&#x27;Mono&#x27;` suffix is not supposed to have any ligatures.
Use the non-*Mono* variants to have ligatures.

### Explanation

Once you narrow down your font choice of family (`Droid Sans`, `Inconsolata`, etc) and style (`bold`, `italic`, etc) you have 2 main choices:

#### `Option 1: Download already patched font`

 * download an already patched font from the `complete` folder
   * This is most likely the one you want. It includes **all** of the glyphs from all of the glyph sets. Only caution here is that some fonts have glyphs in the _same_ code point so to include everything some had to be moved to alternate code points.

#### `Option 2: Patch your own font`

 * patch your own variations with the various options provided by the font patcher (see each font&#x27;s readme for full list of combinations available)
   * This is the option you want if the font you use is _not_ already included or you want maximum control of what&#x27;s included
   * This contains a list of _all permutations_ of the various glyphs. E.g. You want the font with only [Octicons][octicons] or you want the font with just [Font Awe
