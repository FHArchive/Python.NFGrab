Nerd Fonts patches developer targeted fonts with a high number of glyphs
(icons). Specifically to add a high number of extra glyphs from popular
'iconic fonts' such as
[Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome),
[Devicons](https://vorillaz.github.io/devicons/),
[Octicons](https://github.com/primer/octicons), and
[others](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#glyph-sets).
